# LeetCode Daily Streak 🚀
Welcome to my daily LeetCode journey! This repository serves as a personal logbook for my solutions to the daily LeetCode problems. My goal is to build a strong and consistent problem-solving habit, improve my understanding of data structures and algorithms, and track my progress over time.

---

## 🎯 My Goal

* **Consistency:** Solve at least one LeetCode problem every day.
* **Learning:** Deepen my knowledge of common algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving patterns.
* **Quality Code:** Write clean, efficient, and well-documented solutions.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each solution is stored in a separate file and follows a strict naming convention to keep things organized:

`ProblemNameNNNN.extension`

* **`NNNN`**: The LeetCode problem number, padded with leading zeros (e.g., `0001`, `0238`). This ensures proper sorting.
* **`problem-name-in-kebab-case`**: The problem title in all camelcase convention.
* **`.extension`**: The language-specific file extension (e.g., `.py`, `.java`, `.cpp`).

Additionally, each file contains a header comment with:
1.  A link to the problem on LeetCode.
2.  The problem's difficulty level.
3.  A brief explanation of my approach and its time/space complexity.
